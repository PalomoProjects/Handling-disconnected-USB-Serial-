EThis code helps you to detected when the USB Serial is disconnected the code is in python and running in Linux distro

Each project is different but is very important to know the status about the hardware that you controller in your driver, for that reason I share with you this little pice of code for detected when the USB Serial is disconnected, this is important because you can send a message (like email or alarm in the screen) if the hardware is disconnected.

Is very important mentioned that the structure in Linux is relevant in this case, because everything in Linux is a path (file) so this skills give you the ability for manage and know the status of them.
